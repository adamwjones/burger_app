## Description

This project is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Then, whenever the user submits a burger's name, this app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured! Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Eat Me! ` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. Finally, this app stores every burger in a SQL database, whether devoured or not.

This app leverages MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It follows an MVC design pattern and uses Node and MySQL to query and route data throughout app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
